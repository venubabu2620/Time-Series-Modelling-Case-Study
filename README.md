The mini project was splited into 3 parts; 

ARMA model and forecast of oil price time series data
Proposed a new solution for modelling and forecasting 
A report describing the analysis 

üõ¢Ô∏è Brent Crude Oil Price Forecasting ‚Äì Time Series Analysis
This project aims to forecast Brent crude oil prices 24 months into the future using a combination of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The models implemented include:

ARIMA / SARIMAX / ARMA (statistical models)

Random Forest & XGBoost (machine learning)

LSTM (deep learning)

Facebook Prophet (trend-seasonality decomposition)

üìå Key Features
Complete EDA and stationarity checks (ADF, ACF, PACF)

Hyperparameter tuning (Random Forest)

Recursive multi-step forecasting

Forecast accuracy evaluated using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R¬≤

Visual comparisons with actual Brent prices from FRED

Confidence intervals where applicable

Interpretable insights and recommendations for future improvements
